Bloch distribution
==================

This Python module has code for calculating and sampling from the distribution
over projectors that the measurement described by [Das and Arvind][DA2014]
corresponds to. This code was used in the generation of some of the figures in
my paper published on the arXiv under [1506.08892][arxivid].
